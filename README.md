Design and Develop and develop a comprehensive Course 
Selection and Teacher Assignment System for a university. In this system, 
each student must choose 4 theory courses and 2 lab courses per semester, 
selecting a teacher for each course from an available pool. The system should 
feature a user-friendly interface and a robust database to manage course 
selections, teacher assignments, and student preferences. Students will be able 
to view detailed teacher profiles, including ratings from the last four years, 
research projects, patents, and academic background. The platform should 
also allow students to submit feedback on their experience with each teacher. 
The goal is to create a seamless and data-driven platform that optimizes 
course-teacher matching, enhancing the academic experience by providing 
students with the necessary tools to make informed decisions based on 
teacher performance and expertise.# Course-Teacher-Selection
